In this project i aim to work with digital signal processing, i won't be using MIDI to generate sounds,
instead i'll create them myself using combinations of sine waves, square waves, triangle waves and 
sawtooth waves. i will also create the infrastructure required for playing songs which includes but is
not limited to: tempo (bpm), time signature, musical note frequencies.
When the whole music part is completed i might expand the project to use computer vision in order
to transpose an image with the music sheet into the correct notes and periods, removing laborous task of
manually writing them down
